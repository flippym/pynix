# Pynix
RHEL Ready Framework

## Synopsis

Pynix is a Python framework for RHEL-like operative systems, which creates parsing, logging, bash-completion, rpm and many others, for integrating Python programs with the operative system with ease. It can also run Python scripts and daemons without any mandatory parameters and it's highly modular, meaning you can make your program run as you would like.

## Installation

The only dependencies needed by the framework are listed below.

Needed packages:
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)
- [PyYAML](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml)

The framework was tested to run only in RHEL-like distributions.
